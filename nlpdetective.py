# Part 2: Mystery Story
story = """Detective Verstappen had seen a lot in his twenty years with the CIA, 
but the case in Paris was unlike anything heâ€™d encountered before. 
A priceless treasure had vanished from the Museum. 
under impossible circumstances no broken windows, no tripped alarms. 
The only clue was a single red rose left on the empty wall where the painting once hung. 
His contact at Interpol insisted it was the work of the elusive TAUGAMMA, 
an art theft syndicate rumored to operate across Europe. 
But as he examined the rose more closely, He noticed something odd,
a tiny engraving inside the stem, resembling a musical note. He'd seen that symbol 
before in a file buried deep within the FBI archives, linked not to thieves, but to spies."""
